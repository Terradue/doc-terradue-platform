This pan-European partnership across academia and industry is in line with the Digital Agenda of the European Commission and will foster innovation for science and create new commercial markets.

EMBL\'s novel cloud-based whole-genome-assembly and annotation pipeline involves expertise from the Genomics Core facility in Germany, EMBL\'s European Bioinformatics Institute, and EMBL Heidelberg\'s IT Services.

In the framework of the European Space Agency\'s Earth Observation Grid (G-POD) project Terradue will provide an operational interface to storage and computing resources available on the Amazon Cloud. Terradue will have as sub-contractor in this project Critical Software, a Portuguese company well known for providing solutions, services and technologies for mission and business critical information systems across several markets. Additionally Terradue will demonstrate the effective usability of such resources in real EO data processing scenarios by integrating complex ERS processors with more than 30 terabytes of input data that will generate another 40 terabytes of Earth Observation products using Amazon cloud computing platform (aws).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Grid model developed by Terradue for G-POD has proven to overcome known problems that haunt Earth Observation services with paradigm change in the data and application flows. This paradigm change reduces the strain on the network, optimizes the use of processing resources, reduces data access time delays and shipping issues substantially or eliminates them completely, and provides a framework for IPR enforcement and management.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral third-party applications and services are currently integrated in G-POD and supported by Terradue at the European Space Agency using the gridify application environment. Global maps for vegetation, ice or detection of algal blooms among many other applications have proven the validity and performance of this concept.\r\nWhile this infrastructure uses mainly protocols and a Grid model for processing and data access, the inner concept of application encapsulation and virtualization can be extended to other models. The growing interest and availability of Cloud Computing resources opens a new opportunity to expand this model to a new economic framework. In fact, cloud computing provides a dynamically scalable and often virtualized resource as a service over the Internet. The term cloud, maybe seen a metaphor for the Internet itself, is a computer network and an abstraction for the complex infrastructure it conceals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if sometimes cloud computing is defined as a special flavour of Grid computing, or just a new marketing term, it really provides a new level of functionality and an economic model. Renting resource usage from major third-party providers with strong QoS, reporting and billing avoids major capital expenditure on hardware and network resources. Most importantly its usefulness might be seen when urgent peak needs of processing or data distribution are required.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch a situation is clearly represented in the current project. The reprocessing of a historical archive of global radar ERS data, covering 12 years of acquisitions and totalizing more than 30 terabytes, with complex mathematical and computational algorithms such as the ERS Wind-Scatterometer and ERS Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Wave processors, represents an important opportunity for assessment of the Cloud Computing potential. Apart from the extension of G-POD processing to non-Grid resources, the sheer volume of data and processing resources required will represent a unique environment in which to test the cost-effectiveness of this new technology and associated services.<br>\r\nIn evaluating issues such as processing cost, idle machine time, network speed, and processing capability, one needs to remove the hype and marketing language of a commercial context in order to arrive at a real operational scenario.
